        <p>On the evening of the first day of May, Soren visited Karim&rsquo;s
          Cafe on the corner. Most of the seating was street-side, as the cafe
          itself could not fit more than two tables beside its small counter
          and kitchen. The black metal tables outside wobbled, and often
          required patrons to stuff ample packets of napkins under its
          legs. Among the tables were orchid-colored crape myrtles. The trees
          were not yet blooming, and when the winds rustled them, a few leaves
          fell. The cafe was the namesake of Mr Karim, a soft-spoken Iranian
          widower who smiled through his eyes. His hair and beard have long
          gone wholly grey, and as he liked to recount the harsher times of
          his life to his regular customers, they had lost their black sheen
          when he learned of his wife&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s deaths
          during the Revolution. He walked as softly as he spoke, weaving from
          table to table, eventually stopping in front of Soren&rsquo;s.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;My friend, it is good to see you again.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Soren wished Mr Karim peace in reply, greeting him as an old
          friend. He caught a reflection of himself shaking Mr Karim&rsquo;s
          hand in the cafe window behind the proprietor. He had hazel, glassy
          eyes and unkempt brown hair. He wore a pair of slip-on loafers, a
          diamond-pattern sage sweater, and jeans. Soren ran his hand through
          his hair to give it a part. He decided he didn&rsquo;t like the part
          and re-ruffled his hair. He look tired in the reflection, he
          thought, and older than he was. In the end, he decided that he liked
          that.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The usual today, sir?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Please, Mr Karim. One lahmacun and tea.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. How is your manuscript?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I am here to work on that exactly, Mr Karim. Don&rsquo;t
          worry, I will let you read it when I finish, as promised.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Mr Karim smiled, further wrinkling his permanent crow&rsquo;s feet
          around his dark eyes, and walked back to the kitchen to relay the
          order.</p>

        <p>Soren sloughed off his backpack, took out a stack of typewritten
          pages, and put them on the table. Under the weight imbalance, the
          table tilted visibly. A breeze passed through, almost taking away
          the top few pages of his manuscript. Soren produced a glass
          paperweight from his jacket and set it on top of the pile. The pages
          rustled under the breeze. This sound gave comfort to Soren, who felt
          that his words had tangible weight when inked on paper.</p>

        <p>Today, he hoped he would be able to write a page. He would then
          read the entire manuscript again, including the newly-written
          addition for continuity and flow. Then, if all went well, he would
          be able to transcribe it on his typewriter tonight to be added to
          the growing stack currently on the table. Soren felt hopeful and
          self-assured of his plan. To Soren, it was a warm, settling feeling
          that originated in the lungs and slowly moved down to the
          stomach.</p>

        <p>The manuscript was of his attachment to Miranda, a woman he had met
          half a year ago. She had initially spurned him, but also returned
          (and still returns) his affection from time to time while never
          committing. More rarely, they also exchanged mementos. She did this
          with enough regularity that Soren felt conflicted, and in his more
          intoxicated moments, tortured.</p>

        <p>He started writing down his feelings in memoir form in March, when
          the leaves had just budded on these trees, one evening at
          Karim&rsquo;s Cafe. What a wonderful feeling, he thought as he first
          wrote, this warm feeling that starts in the lungs and settles down
          in the stomach. He may have felt tortured, but giving words to his
          suffering made him feel innocent and validated. That evening, God
          might not have been in his Heaven, he convinced himself, but all
          still felt right with the world. Other evenings, he could convince
          himself of nothing.</p>

        <p>More people had come to dine at Karim&rsquo;s. Of the other
          regulars who recognized Soren, some greeted him with a smile.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Working hard, Soren?&rdquo; One patron asked as he patted
          the writer on the back as he scribbled.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Hey there, I&rsquo;m in the middle of a train of
          thought. You understand,&rdquo; Soren looked up briefly, smiled
          briefly, and returned his gaze to his paper.</p>

        <p>In another few minutes, the lahmacun and tea arrived. The simple
          joy of peasant food executed well, he thought with an appreciation
          more than hunger but less than relish. Tearing off pieces and eating
          at a deliberate pace, he finished the meat-on-bread and tea in no
          more than fifteen minutes. The sun was setting; he packed up his
          typewritten pages, his paperweight, and walked home.</p>

        <p>Soren&rsquo;s studio apartment was pitch black as he turned the key
          and pushed open the old wooden door that had expanded during the day
          due to heat. The studio had bare furnishings. Against one off-white
          wall there was a couch and bed, and against the other,
          a <span class="sc">vhs</span> player atop a three-year-old
          television.</p>

        <p>Soren turned on the kitchen light and saw the remains of a
          night&rsquo;s drinking on the coffee table. A half-empty bottle of
          zinfandel that Miranda had brought over and various bottles of hard
          liquors in various states of emptiness.  Remembering last night
          caused him a physical, intestinal pain. It was a feeling of his
          organs being unseated and floating about inside his body.</p>

        <p>Why was it already opened and half-empty when she brought it, Soren
          questioned about the wine. No doubt it was for a night with another
          boy.</p>

        <p>Writing did not help Soren to assuage these sharp pains anchored in
          recent history. He felt that these pains were too fresh and cannot
          be given structure. He poured himself the rest of the wine, which
          soon addled his mind. He called his friend Nesrin. A college friend,
          Soren considered Nesrin his confidante and solace. He looked at them
          as brother and sister, intimate and unconditionally
          loving. Everytime he had contacted her on the brink of tears, she
          had listened and offered advice.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nesrin. It&rsquo;s Soren. I am a little drunk.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Even in his haze, Soren could picture Nesrin, with her hair tied
          back in a single ponytail and wearing grey flannel pants, shuffling
          back and forth from the kitchen and the dining room to listen to him
          and to tend to the stew. He was thankful that his friend was not
          married; Nesrin&rsquo;s unattached state was a comfort he clung onto
          and feared would not continue for much longer.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;God, why do you keep doing this? Is this about
        Miranda?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;She came over to see a movie and we had a few&mdash;we had a
          bunch to drink. I spent the entire night working up the courage to
          hold her, to wait for the right moment so doesn&rsquo;t just brush
          me aside. I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this anymore.&rdquo; Soren
          stood up, turned off the lights, and returned to the couch. He
          supported his forehead with his free hand.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. You need to talk to her. We&rsquo;ve been
          over this a hundred times. I don&rsquo;t have anything left to
          say.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You know what she said to be in the beginning? When we first
          met?  She told me I was her Roman Holiday. Believe me, that <i>I</i>
          was her Roman Holiday.&rdquo; He had told Nesrin that story before,
          but the more he recounted the kinder moments, the more at ease he
          became. He did not mention Miranda&rsquo;s numerous deflections of
          his attempts to talk about his feelings for her.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re slurring. Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I was more confident back then, maybe. So much easier when
          you don&rsquo;t think you have anything to lose.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I want to be here for you, and I will. But how long are you
          going to feel sorry for yourself?&rdquo; Nesrin sighed.</p>

        <p>Soren slumped off the couch. He fumbled to retrieve the glass
          paperweight from his jacket on the couch. Sprawled on the floor and
          palming the paperweight as one would a Chinese medicine ball, he
          repeated similar sentiments to Nesrin. After twenty minutes, she
          hung up.</p>

        <p>Soren continued the ritual of going to Karim&rsquo;s Cafe to write,
          to spend time with Miranda which left him with regrets, and to call
          Nesrin when he felt that even alcohol no longer numbed. Nesrin
          listened, and repeated that she had said all she was going to
          say. Throughout, Soren noticed Nesrin&rsquo;s becoming resigned to
          being the receiver of his afflictions. He resolved to pepper his
          calls with more humorous anecdotes to correct this.</p>

        <p>On the evening of the first day of August, after an early dinner
          that was not at Karim&rsquo;s, Soren called Nesrin. He did not hear
          Nesrin&rsquo;s voice from the receiver. Instead, a recording
          notified him that the number had been disconnected. He poured
          himself a glass of scotch and sat down on the carpet, with his back
          propped up against the couch. Mourning what he had lost and will
          lose, he wept.</p>

        <p>On the evening of the second day of August, Soren visited
          Karim&rsquo;s Cafe. He sat down outside, between the myrtle trees,
          and ordered his usual. As he waited, he put his manuscript on the
          table and his glass paperweight on top. The trees were in bloom now,
          and every so often the breeze would carry a few flowers on top of
          the lahmacun. He ate the meat-on-bread with the wayward petals as
          garnish. He was not sure if this was a good idea.</p>

        <p>That evening, Soren left his manuscript and paperweight on the
          table, paid with a generous tip, and walked away. Mr Karim called
          after the receding figure with no effect. He set the manuscript
          aside and promised himself to read it, so that when Soren returns
          they will have much to talk about. He then picked up the glass
          paperweight and turned it over in his hand. The glass was plain,
          with no colors or patterns. To the bottom of the paperweight was
          glued a small note written in colored gel pen on construction
          paper. The note read
          <span class="sc">to my roman holiday</span>, of which Mr Karim
          thought was a curious thing to have on a paperweight.</p>

        <p>Both manuscript and paperweight sat uncollected for several months,
          during which Mr Karim never found the time to read Soren&rsquo;s
          opus. One evening, Mr Karim threw them away, nestled among other
          discarded things.</p>
