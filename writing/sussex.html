        <p>The violence of water, the driver thought as he negotiated the road
          into Sussex. Many roads encircled the town with one entering proper
          on its way northward to Maine. The route ran parallel to one that
          leviathan whalers might have once taken centuries ago. He had
          learned this in school and wondered if bleached bones rested
          underneath the cliffs of this inlet-hugging road. The rain formed
          sulcate on the windshield. He traced with his eyes raindrops that
          streaked horizontal across the glass. After impact, a drop
          stretches, perhaps coalesces with others, then follows a straight
          line to the edge of the windshield. As rain, water is countable. Not
          many people realize that. He wrested a lever to adjust the wipers
          but they still squeaked.</p>

        <p>The man drove alone. It was his fourth time back, the frequency
          coincidental with that of the storms, and would be his last. He was
          thirty-two with fine hair thinning even more, such that shocks of it
          floated with the breeze. A careful, melancholy man with a restless
          mind that often dwelled on joy.</p>

        <p>Hurricane was to come again to Sussex. The storms were a season in
          their own right, and though the returning man had moved away for a
          great many years, he remembered their recurrences and their
          violence. In 1976, winds of fifty eight miles per hour at adjacent
          Dover; none dead. In 1979, eight point four two million dollars in
          damages; three dead in an accident. In 1985, rainfall of nine point
          zero two inches; sixteen point one nine million in damages; one
          dead. He found solace in these facts that he had studied over the
          years, as he retraced the matter with Teresa in 1985. To him she was
          always Tess.</p>

        <p>He turned his attention to the shoebox on the passenger seat. It
          contained three things:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Tess&rsquo;s frock with flowers, yellowed by age instead of
            dyes, an unadmitted favorite of his and hers;</li>
          <li>A small rock that used to be sharp, from the side of a road that
            was once flooded and that had once drawn blood;</li>
          <li>A torn page from a yearbook laminated to guard against the damp,
            showing an array of girls, Tess included, <span class="sc">sussex
            unified school</span>, during her last year there, 1985, when she
            drowned.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The man adjusted the radio to listen for weather forecasts and
          warnings of flash floods. The roads were slick, and he became
          briefly fearful of losing traction. He had killed the heat to reduce
          the condensation when he noticed the familiar juncture and its
          side-gabled houses with steep-pitched roofs to break hurricane
          winds. When he lived here as a boy, he wondered if these were
          transplanted homesteads, plucked from the countryside by some
          furtive machine, bunched all too close like they were, and deposited
          wholesale in this memory of a whaling town. He knew by heart the
          count of turns and minutes it would take to reach the motel and its
          neighboring diner.</p>

        <p>Sussex spirals outward from its founding docks a sluggard, tendrils
          reaching for dryer, higher southern plains. The motel sat on the end
          of a heartseeker road, bisecting Sussex&rsquo;s arabesque spiral to
          its core. The building stood as a series of connected rectangles and
          did not have steep-pitched roofs. The driver parked the car in the
          sparse lot. He took the shoebox and a raincoat from the backseat. He
          tugged the collars stiff, walked into the clerk&rsquo;s office, and
          rented a room for one night.</p>

        <p>The renter walked briskly to his room on the second floor just
          behind a corner, unlocked the door, and set down the box on the lone
          armchair in front of the window, the edges of it aligning parallel
          with the edges of the armchair. Afterwards, he half-jogged back
          through the rain, downstairs, across the street, then into the
          diner, all the while listening to the violence of water against tin
          awning and wondering how such loudness did not pierce those thin tin
          sheets.</p>

      <section>
        <p>It was when the man had just finished his coffee that a woman from
          the booth diagonally across from his own recognized him.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Look at you, don&rsquo;t you look practically the
        same,&rdquo; she said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>He looked up at the woman and, in his fatigue, was reminded of
          Tess. To think Tess as a woman and to place her thin, bare shoulders
          elsewhere in time, he thought, is a remarkable thing.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary! Christ, you know, Mary? Sussex Unified? Sat
          near the front with the other Irish girls. I&rsquo;d recognize you
          anywhere, but I guess we&rsquo;re all a little worse for wear after
          all these years,&rdquo; she said of herself, but it made the man
          self-conscious. She sat down in his booth, to the whispering of her
          friends she had left behind.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mary, yes. Sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting something like
          this. Didn&rsquo;t recognize you immediately. Still here?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for, what, twenty some years and
          you ask if I still live here? I don&rsquo;t remember you being
          boring.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Well, I moved away.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;And I tried,&rdquo; she said this with lonesome courage
          indigenous to Sussex. Upon leaving after the accident, he would feel
          sadness from not having known more of it.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Christ, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe not hard enough. This town
          still feels like it just swallows you right up with all its history
          and not enough people. But our seaside cliffs are pretty, and I know
          how to make myself happy. That&rsquo;s what I tell myself
          anyways,&rdquo; she said and leaned in with a smile for
          herself. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you move away for?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I went to study&mdash;&rdquo; he rubbed his eyes,
          &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s great to see you, but I just
          drove for eight hours.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it a good thing you just had coffee
          then. So, why&rsquo;re you back?  Folk don&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo;
          she half-whispered, leaning in further. &ldquo;Not the good-looking
          ones anyways.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;For the storm, in a way, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Just when everyone else is getting away from the damn
          thing. But not us, huh? We grew up in this town.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Mary&rsquo;s friends walked over and and told her to come to
          Lou&rsquo;s to keep drinking, that she needed to celebrate the
          occasion. She said she was almost done catching up, that the man was
          a childhood friend of hers. One of them held the man&rsquo;s gaze
          for a second too long, then gave Mary a look. She told them five
          minutes, and they walked out in file.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;There was a charm here. But a lot comes with charm. The
          streets used to flood,&rdquo; the man said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, and we used to swim at night whenever it did. God,
          remember that?  Weren&rsquo;t them summer nights just perfect. That
          poor girl from that year, though, bad luck.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The man sat up to attention. For Sussex children, the watery
          escapades were joyous rebellions against adults who had seen the
          violence of water. Mary looked at his empty cup of coffee, and he
          noticed she was still smiling, just barely. It occurred to him that
          Mary has known the joy of looking at the same rain and swimming in
          the same waters as Tess.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only in town until tomorrow. Why don&rsquo;t you
          stop by the motel after Lou&rsquo;s? If reminiscing&rsquo;s not too
          boring. I do remember those summer nights,&rdquo; he replied and
          tried to return her smile in kind. She paused. He became nervous and
          brooded on the agony of spontaneity, on the gap between his front
          teeth when he was a boy, and on the money he had spent to correct
          it.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, good-looking, maybe,&rdquo; Mary said, stood up, and
        left the diner.</p>

        <p>The man returned to the front of his motel room door in haste. He
          fumbled the fob and pushed the door with uncharacteristic
          force. Once the door had closed he found himself calmer with the
          loudness of rain subdued. In swipes of the hand he wiped the
          raincoat, folded the heavy fabric twice-over, first lengthwise, then
          crosswise, and hung it on the door. Calmness threatened to leave him
          as he wondered why he had propositioned Mary. After pacing between
          the armchair next to the bed and the bathroom door in repetition, he
          sat down on the bed&rsquo;s edge facing the box on the armchair by
          the window. He unlidded the box and cradled it.</p>

      <section>
        <p>One early afternoon in the summer of 1985, a hurricane made
          landfall near Sussex. After school, a boy walked back to a small
          house on a grassy incline that overlooked a bend in the
          street. Beside him was a girl who smiled and looked at him when she
          spoke. Under her translucent raincoat, a floral dress was visible
          but blurred. The rain had not started in earnest, and the day was
          bright. She ran in polka-dotted rainboots into the neighboring
          house, yelling back at the boy that she will be there soon. He ran
          into the house on the incline, threw his bookbag on the linoleum of
          the foyer, and plodded down on the living room carpet. He turned on
          the television in the corner to the weather service.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Is school cancelled tomorrow or what?&rdquo; asked the girl
          as she came in without her raincoat, short of breath and her dress
          damp.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Look at this huge swirl coming right over to us,&rdquo; the
          boy crawled next to the television and pointed, &ldquo;Might be even
          cancelled for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>She changed the channel, and they watched a show with a laugh track
          in the growing loudness of the outside rain.</p>

        <p>When the show ended, she laid down prone on the carpet and rolled
          over to her back.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&rdquo; she
        asked.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Not a truck driver for the cannery like
          my dad was. Maybe a poet, an honest one.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah right, you couldn&rsquo;t even finish your summer
          readings and had to cheat off me for the book reports.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The boy scoffed.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Me, my mom never talked about dad much, but when I&rsquo;m
          older I&rsquo;m going to be a mother and have a boy and a girl, two
          dogs, and a big house in California,&rdquo; the girl continued.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Eww, and who&rsquo;s going to make babies with you? That guy
          behind you in English class?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Shut up! I bet you would!&rdquo; she yelled and punched his
        arm.</p>

        <p>The boy scrambled on all fours to where she was lying. As neighbors
          and as children whose single mothers bonded during their travails,
          they have played together for years. He knew how to pull his
          punches. She looked at him with indignant eyes. He knew the slight
          smile on her lips was an invitation. Their dance-tussle took them
          round the small living room in circles among whorling zebra-stripe
          shadows cast by the mounting storm.</p>

        <p>As the boy noticed the sudden darkness of rain, the phone rang in
          the kitchen. His mother told him that streets out of the office
          building were flooded. She told him she would not be able to make it
          home, that there were bologna and bread, and to not stay up too
          late. The boy told her yes with a glint in his eyes.</p>

        <p>He ran back to the living room. &ldquo;My mom won&rsquo;t make it
          home tonight,&rdquo; he told her.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;That means mine won&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; she said. Then
        they smiled at each other.</p>

        <p>Kneeling on the couch in front of the window, they counted passing
          cars fleeing from the rain bare shoulder to bare shoulder. They ate
          pudding pops and felt sick. They found and chewed disclosing
          tablets, making contorted faces at the taste. With gapped, dyed
          teeth bared they pretended to be ravenous animals, chasing each
          other from room to room in the incadescence of the house. Then they
          went back to the television and watched another show for another
          hour, until the power went out.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Look at the street,&rdquo; the girl said to the boy as she
          stood up in the now dark parlor.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally flooded. The rain&rsquo;s died down a
        bit, too.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I hope it drains soon.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;No way. Let&rsquo;s go swimming.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? It&rsquo;s filthy in there. You&rsquo;re
          going to be in <i>so</i> much trouble if someone sees
          you.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to see us. Even the traffic
          lights&rsquo;re off. Come on,&rdquo; he said and grabbed her
          hand. They walked out onto the porch.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You want me to swim wearing this?&rdquo; she asked and
        tugged at her dress.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;So take it off,&rdquo; the boy said as he took off his
          t-shirt and jeans. He sprinted down the incline in front of the
          house, hopping over the culvert, and into the water. Stepping on a
          small, sharp rock concealed by mud, he yelped in pain. In anger he
          threw it towards the house. At its deepest, the water came to the
          boy&rsquo;s neck, where he dove in and swam a few, quick circles in
          front of the house. Right arm, head turn, left arm, repeat. He
          motioned for the girl to join him, but she shook her head.</p>

        <p>He swam back to the edge of the incline, climbed out, and ran back
          towards the girl standing on the porch.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Tess, come <i>on</i>.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I bet you just want to see my
        bra!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Like I want to see something like that! You&rsquo;re just
        chicken.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I am not! You better turn around until I&rsquo;m in the
        water.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Close your eyes, too!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Fine, not like I can see much.&rdquo; The boy turned his
          back to the porch and closed his eyes. He listened to the rain
          keeping in sync with his own heartbeat. When he heard wet footsteps
          on grass he opened his eyelids slightly with measured precision. He
          saw thin, bare shoulders held triumphant against the shivered paper
          moon reflected in lapping floodwater.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said from the water, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s
          chicken now? You going to make me wait?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The boy dashed back into the water.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the bend,&rdquo; he said and pointed
          to the corner where the road turned left. &ldquo;First one there and
          back has to do what the other one says!&rdquo; he said, and with
          large, fluid strokes swam ahead of her. He heard her kicking water
          behind him.</p>

        <p>He swam with purpose, counting his strokes. The cut in his foot
          stung now and again but did not deter him. Grateless culverts on
          either side of the road siphoned the water with violent currents,
          which he knew to avoid by keeping to the center of the road. He
          reached the bend and doubled back, head down, focused on one stroke
          then the next. The boy reached the grassy incline of his house
          first, victorious. He ran back up to the porch and saw the crumpled
          dress next to his clothes, florals in the pale light. Without
          getting dressed himself, he picked up the dress, ran inside into his
          room, and stuffed it under his bed, grinning. She&rsquo;ll be very
          angry, but he&rsquo;ll make it up to her, he thought.</p>

        <p>The boy waited on the porch for a great while, until a leviathan
          strangled him stilly from deeper, more violent waters.</p>

        <p>A knock came at the hotel door; in panic, the man left the box on
          the bathroom sink counter on his way to answer the door, its edges
          unaligned. He opened the door to Mary.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d gone to Lou&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the man
        said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, Lou&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. My
        friends neither.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I have nothing here to drink, you came earlier than I
        thought.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh, is that why I came over? So, you going to make me stand
        outside?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Come in, you&rsquo;re soaked.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The man brought out a towel and shut the bathroom door. As he
          veiled her with the white towel, she leaned in and kissed him,
          perfumed rum vapor in tow. As her lips rested on his and his hands
          rested on the white towel, he felt a happy confidence not unlike a
          happiness of childhood. When she pulled her mouth from his, he
          shrank back.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I wanted to do this, really. I find you very
        attractive.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Then come here.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m one of those men who can only make love to
          someone he knows completely,&rdquo; he explained and looked beyond
          her at the door, thinking of a crumpled dress.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Make love? No. No, you were about to get laid.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What do you think the difference is?&rdquo; he asked as it
          struck him that she looked tired.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Let me show you,&rdquo; she said with a lowered voice and
          leaned in again. He resisted.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mary, it&rsquo;s not you. I thought I was ready.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this. Why did you ask me back here
        then?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I only mean to be honest. You are very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Usually honest men don&rsquo;t need to explain. You know
          what? Whatever, fine. I get it. I&rsquo;ll just leave,&rdquo; she
          said and did not leave. She looked at him. He looked away. She
          looked at him. He looked at her. She looked at him. She shook her
          head and turned to the door.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Wait! Back in the diner, you said you remember the girl who
          died?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What? A little. No, why bring that up?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I need to know if you remember&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Do you remember Tess?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Jesus. What is wrong with you?&rdquo; she half-turned back
          to him, then turned away again, more hurried.</p>

        <p>The man regretted being hasty. He grabbed her shoulder and pleaded,
          &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything bad.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mary said and opened the door. Once
          outside the threshold, she turned to face him and continued,
          &ldquo;I got plenty of men right here who&rsquo;re so wrapped up in
          themselves that they&rsquo;re lonely even with a woman.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The man said nothing and thought so ceaselessly of floodwaters that
          he only half-listened to her thanking him for the towel and her
          saying, in a lower voice, that she was going to Lou&rsquo;s, as she
          should have done in the first place, to celebrate with her friends
          her long overdue divorce with another self-absorbed man.</p>

        <p>After Mary left, the man grew restless. He smelled the kiss in the
          white towel and could not reconcile the promise of intimacy with
          Sussex and what came with it. He swung open the bathroom door to
          retrieve his box.</p>

        <p>The frock he laid on the hotel bed flat. He caressed its seams with
          his hands gently, ant trails among tulips and petunias. From the hem
          to the waist, upward to the bust, left shoulder first, around the
          neckline, and repeat for the right side. He found comfort in the
          dress during the first months after Tess&rsquo;s drowning, when he
          had nightmares of an incruent corpse. Tess&rsquo;s body was never
          found, and he never revealed that he had hidden her dress. In the
          hotel room the man traced the seams with increasing speed and
          frustration.</p>

        <p>The small rock he held briefly, fingers moving from mortise to
          mortise. He wanted to throw it at Mary, who was no longer there.</p>

        <p>Unable to reorient himself, he exited the room a wraith, holding
          the laminated page and the dress wrapped around the rock. He headed
          to his car and tossed his relics onto the back seat. The car turned
          and sped off, deeper into Sussex. He drove unseated on roads more
          serpentine than he remembered, trying to calm himself with higher
          speeds. The rain fell now more intensely; his eyes darting to the
          trail of raindrops on windshield, more numerous and more
          desperate. Speeding past the side-gabled houses, he cursed and
          accelerated.</p>

        <p>The car careened off road near the center of Sussex&rsquo;s
          spiral. The wheels slid frictionless on the thin film of water and
          carried the car straight, into the shoulders, where roadside rocks
          flayed the steel of the car in a high-pitched whine. The car
          overturned twice and sloughed off its skin of water in exhale. The
          violence of water is a curious thing, he thought.</p>

        <p>A passerby called for the ambulance. The paramedics informed him of
          a collapsed lung, broken ribs, a concussion. He asked the paramedics
          where his car had been taken. His voice was croupy. He told them he
          had valuables in the car.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault. It&rsquo;s all
        right. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>He was unsure if it was their place to say.</p>

        <p>In the following days at the hospital, the man drifted in and out
          of sleep. In his waking moments, he was calm like spent men often
          were, after they realized they no longer had to fight. With his
          relics destroyed, he knew he would eventually forget the particulars
          of that night and even Tess&rsquo;s likeness. The hurricane was now
          diminished, and periodic showers pattered on the window of his
          room. Doing her rounds, the shift nurse came in and asked if he
          wanted anything. He looked at the lines of rain on the window and
          told her that no, he wanted for nothing, then drifted back to
          sleep.</p>

        <p>On the carpet in the parlor of his small house he and she laid
          prone playing.  Bruised knees dug into the carpet with raised feet
          swaying. The sun pierced roiling clouds crepuscular. The rain only
          whispered now but the streets were already flooded. The boy and the
          girl wrapped in moving shadows and kissed by damp breeze played
          heads down, oblivious. But then the boy noticed the ordinary miracle
          of water. He stood and saw a deluged world inexhaustible and
          wondrous. Beckoned, he opened the porch door.  The girl raised
          bobbing flaxen ringlets cascading on carpet to peer through and with
          the boy. Past the threshold they saw the water gently afire with
          half-set sun. The boy looked back gaptoothed grinning to the girl
          and extended his hand. The girl climbed to her feet and reached
          forward to take his hand in smiling communion. A great searing
          pierced the boy, an inchoate sensation he mistook as pain. Hands
          clasped they stood on the porch, coiled springs, beholding the
          flooded street. He helped her unzip that flowery frock and they
          discarded their clothes. In unison they sprinted to the
          water&rsquo;s edge, paused slightly in the coolness, and waded in
          waist-height. Small, sharp rocks coaxed no blood from the
          boy&rsquo;s feet. He fashioned her hands a cruet, cupped water, then
          guided her arms skyward fluid and swift. Droplets fell out of her
          hands and rippled across the flooded street in placid calm of summer
          evening unbowed by her laughter. The boy looked at the girl. They
          leaped into the water hands raised as one and swam with a joy
          invincible.</p>
